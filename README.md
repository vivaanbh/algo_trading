Three algorithmic trading case studies were prepared for a Case Competition. Each case is a 5-minute simulation.

Case 1: **Algorithmic Market Making**
- three securities: CNR, ALG, AC
- capture the bid-ask spread while providing liquidity to the market.
- exposure to market risk.

Case 2: **ETF Arbitrage Case**
- ETF: INDX; securities: RGLD, RFIN.
- capture arbitrage opportunities by creation and redemption of units.
- prices are uncorrelated.
- ETF is less efficient to incorporate news, hence, there exist arbitrage opportunities.

Case 3: **Price Discovery**
- ETF consisting of UB and GEM, all three are tradable securities.
- 10 news items come and each security will follow a random price path and will have a final value between a specific interval in each case.
- using the news items, the trader must estimate the final value of the security and trade accordingly.
